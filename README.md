Hi everyone,

I'm IF59. I'm interested in novels, films, and learning. 
My big dream is to build a successful software that can translate my favorite novels smoothly. 
Thatâ€™s why I decided to study AI at HCMUS. I work hard every day to move closer to my goal.

"That's right, .I love the fact that I work hard."
