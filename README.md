## üéÆGame Features and Player Options
In this game, you have the option to create an account and log in, or you can choose to play in "GUEST" mode for a quick start. Our "OPTIONS" section provides a variety of features, including viewing game leaderboards, adjusting sound settings, and saving or loading your games. You can also find a "CREDITS" section that acknowledges our dedicated team members and trainers. For your convenience, comprehensive instructions are available, along with a "HELP" section to guide you through gameplay. When you're ready to take a break, simply head to the "QUIT" section to exit the game. In the "PLAYER" section, we offer three challenging levels, two exciting game modes, and three sophisticated algorithms to suggest optimal paths. Plus, you can customize the maze by selecting the positions of Tam and Gia Huy for a personalized experience!
## üß†Algorithms
To enhance players' navigation experience, we employ three powerful algorithms: Depth-first search (DFS), A*, and Breadth-first search (BFS). These algorithms are seamlessly integrated with the "SUGGEST" button, offering tailored route recommendations. Players can easily choose from these algorithms to find the most efficient path from Tam's current location to Gia Huy's position.
## üìåConclusion

Your valuable suggestions and insights are greatly welcomed, as they will help us refine the game to its fullest potential. Thank you once again for your support, and we look forward to sharing an even more engaging and improved project with you in the future!
